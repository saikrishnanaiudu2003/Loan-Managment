# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




Frontend (React):
UI Components:
Create React components for:
Adding a new loan.
Displaying the list of loans.
Showing loan details and monthly payment breakdown.
Filtering loans by type or interest rate.
State Management:
Manage the list of loans using React state.
Use controlled components for loan input forms.
API Integration:
Use fetch or axios to interact with the Flask backend.
Implement API calls to:
Add a new loan.
Retrieve loan data.
Calculate and display monthly payments.
Basic Styling:
Apply simple CSS or use a UI framework to make the application user-friendly.
